## Introduction

Continual-NExT is a continual learning benchmark for **Large Foundation Modals (LFMs)** developed based on the ms-swift framework, focusing on the catastrophic forgetting of LFMs in the process of continual evolution. It integrates multiple modalities, multiple models, multiple tuning paradigms, and multiple continual learning (CL) methods, allowing researchers to freely combine these components in developing new methods to solve **the trade-off between stability and plasticity** in LFMs.

In addition to using the datasets supported by the ms-swift framework, Continual-NExT also supports interfaces for continual fine-tuning of public and private datasets. In addition, we also provide a new open-source dataset based on Large Language Models (LLMs), **Continual-News Knowledge Evolution** to help researchers better understand the continual evolution process of LLMs.

In summary, our benchmark includes the following advantages:

**• Scalability:** Easily scales to accommodate multiple large language models (LLMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), parameter-efficient fine-tuners, and diverse datasets.

**• Flexibility:** Supports the flexible combination of diverse model architectures, parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigms, and anti-forgetting methods.

**• Convenience:** Enables seamless usage with a one-command "plug-and-train" interface.

**• Extensibility:** Provides strong support and adaption of novel anti-forgetting methods.

## Training and Evaluation
### Training
  
For training 'Reply' on Internlm2.5-7b
```shell
sh train/internlm_train_reply.sh
```

For training 'LWF' on Qwen2.5-7b
```shell
sh train/qwen_train_lwf.sh
```

For training 'EWC' on Internlm2.5-7b
```shell
sh train/internlm_train_ewc.sh
```

For training 'GEM' on Qwen2.5-7b
```shell
sh train/qwen_train_gem.sh
```

"--model" is the model path. If the file does not exist, it will be downloaded online. For specific details, please refer to [swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift).

Adapters steps calculation procedure is as follows:  
$$\text{steps} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{num-samples}}{\text{per-device-train-batch-size} \times \text{NPROC-PER-NODE}} \right\rceil \times \text{num-train-epochs}$$   
$\lceil \cdot \rceil$ denotes rounding up to the nearest integer. Subsequently, the path is "--adapters ms-swift-main/output/{ouput_dir}/2022/{steps}".

Please note that the implementation of LWF in Qwen does not support flash_attn.


### Evaluation
To calculate the performance metrics of the model results, we first need to deploy the model as a background service to ensure continuous operation. Here's a sample: Use the final model trained on 2025 data to test 2022 data:  


#### 1. Deploy the model service in the background  
```shell
# Run the deployment script in the background and redirect output to a log file
nohup sh evaluation/deploy.sh &> deployment.log &
# Check the process status (replace <PID> with the actual process ID if needed)
ps -ef | grep deploy.sh
```  

- **Infer_backend configuration**:  
  The `--infer_backend` can be set to `pt` or `vllm`. For detailed instructions, refer to [swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift).  
  **Note**: MoELoRA does not support `vllm` during deployment—use `pt` instead.  


#### 2. Execute subsequent scripts in a new terminal  
After deploying the service, open a new terminal window to proceed with generating responses and calculating metrics:  

```python
# Generate model responses and save to files
python evaluation/test_ans.py
# Calculate performance metrics (e.g., similarity scores)
python evaluation/sim.py
```  


#### 3. Key considerations  
- **Background service management**:  
  - To stop the service, find the process ID with `ps -ef | grep deploy.sh` and use `kill <PID>`.  
  - Logs are stored in `deployment.log` for troubleshooting.  

- **Path modifications**:  
  Ensure to update the corresponding files and model paths in `deploy.sh`, `test_ans.py`, and `sim.py` to match your environment.  


This approach allows the service to run continuously in the background while you execute evaluation scripts in a separate terminal, ensuring non-blocking workflow execution.

### Distributed Training

SWIFT originally supports distributed training by using DDP/FSDP/DeepSpeed. In our modification, we select the DeepSpeed method to implement distributed training.  The following Table shows the compatibility status of each continual learning PEFT/method with various DeepSpeed ZeRO configurations.

| Method                                 | Single GPU | ZeRO-0 | ZeRO-1 | ZeRO-2 | ZeRO-3 | ZeRO-3+Offload |

**Legend**:

- ✅ Compatible
- 🚫 Not compatible

**Incompatibility Reasons**:

- **GEM,**  **CIA**: Requires obtaining gradient and parameters which are incompatible with ZeRO-1 and above due to the way gradients and parameters are partitioned across devices.
- **EWC**: Requires obtaining parameters which are incompatible with ZeRO-2 and above due to the way parameters are partitioned across devices.

## Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy is obtained with the following steps:

1. **Encoding with BERT**
    We use a pretrained multilingual BERT model (e.g., `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`) to convert each assistant reply and corresponding ground truth into a high-dimensional vector (embedding) that captures the **semantic meaning** of the text.

2. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**
    For each pair of replies and ground truths, we compute the **cosine similarity** between their embeddings. This value ranges from 0 (irrelated meaning) to 1 (identical meaning), with values close to 1 indicating that the two responses are semantically very similar.

3. **Output**
    We print the similarity score for each matched pair and compute the **average similarity score across all pairs**, which gives a quantitative measure of how semantically similar the assistant responses are between the replies and ground truths.

In conclusion, Accuracy can be calculated as:

$$\text{Similarity}(A,B)=\text{cos}(v_A,v_B)=\frac{v_A·v_B}{∥v_A∥·∥v_B∥}$$

$v_A$: The BERT embedding vector of text A

$v_B$: The BERT embedding vector of text B

$·$: Dot product of the two vectors

$∥⋅∥$: L2 norm (i.e., length) of the vector

$cos⁡(v_A,v_B)$: Cosine similarity between vectors A and B, ranging from 0 to 1

**Average Accuracy (Avg.ACC)** is used for averaging the test accuracy of all datasets, which represents the comprehensive performance of continual tuning.

$$\text{Average Accuracy} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{T}A_{T,i},$$

**Forgetting (FOR)** is utilized to indicate the test accuracy reduction of past datasets after learning the new dataset, which denotes the stability performance.

$$\text{Forgetting} = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{i=1}^{T-1}{A_{T,i} – \text{max}(A_{j,i})_{j \in [i,T-1]}},$$

**New Accuracy (New.ACC)** is employed to average the test accuracy of new datasets, which refers to the plasticity performance.

$$\text{New Accuracy} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{T}A_{i,i},$$

where $T$ is the number of datasets, $A_{T,i}$ is the accuracy of $i$-th dataset on the model trained after $T$-th dataset, $A_{j,i}$ is the accuracy of $i$-th dataset on the model trained after $j$-th dataset, and $A_{i,i}$ is the accuracy of $i$-th dataset on the model trained after $i$-th dataset.

## Experimental Results

We implemented two parameter efficient fine-tunings (*i.e.* LoRA and MoELoRA), and five continual learning methods (namely Replay, LWF, EWC, GEM and CIA based on LoRA fine-tuning) on our proposed Continual-News dataset. Results are shown in the following two Tables.
